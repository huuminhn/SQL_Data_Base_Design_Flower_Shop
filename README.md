## Database Design: A Flower Shop Project
### (Via MySQL WorkBench)

Please use the Dump files to load in the database.  

This is a team project that design a database for a local flower store to optimize the business operation. The process involve data entry, ETL and applying queries as demanded. 
I included 12 SQL queries used in this database ( including lag, lead, stored procedure, nested queries, ...) in a .sql file, the ER diagram with FK and PK in a PDF file, the data we input mannualy and the dump file used to construct the database model in Workbench.

--- 

### Milestone 1:
1. Developed a conceptual model that have over 16 entities and a number of attributes, ensure the Intergrity Constrains( PK, FK, Uniqueness).  
2. Insert captions and description that explains the entities and attributes of the conceptual model and help simplify the databse concepts to the flower shop owners.  
3. Wrote a mission statement that best describes the main goals of the flower botique.  

### Milestone 2:

1. Physical Database generation:  
- Foward Engineer the model so it became a database, then ensure synchronization any further changes into the database.  
2. Populate the Database with data:
- Creat CSV files according to the entities in the database, each entity equal to one CSV file.  
- Input data of the flower botique into such CSV files.  
- Upload those CSV files to the database to generate data.  
3. Create relevant SQL queries.  

### Milestone 3:

1. Deployed the database to AWS cloud.  
2. Tableau:
- Visualize the necessary charts that help ultilizing the business's demands. 
- Provide insights and key findings of the database analytical process.
